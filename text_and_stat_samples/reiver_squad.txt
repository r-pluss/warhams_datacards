ABILITIES
And They Shall Know No Fear
(pg 131)

Grapnel Launchers
When models with grapnel launchers move, do not count any vertical distance they move against the total they can move that turn (i.e. moving vertically is free for these models). In addition, during deployment, you can set up this unit, if it is equipped with grapnel launchers, behind enemy lines instead of placing it on the battlefield. At the end of your Movement phases this unit can join the battle - set it up within 6" of a battlefield edge of your choice and more than 9" away from any enemy models.

Combat Squads
Before any models are deployed at the start of the game, an Intercessor Squad containing 10 models may be split into two units, each containing 5 models.

Terror Troops
Enemy units must subtract 1 from their Leadership if they are within 3" of any Reiver Squads.

Grav-chutes
During deployment, you can set up this unit, if it is equipped with grav-chutes, in high orbit instead of placing it on battlefield. At the end of any of your Movement phases this unit can descend - set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from any enemy models.
